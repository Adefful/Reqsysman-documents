# Customize this template

This template is pre-populated with the most common fields for docs (like creator and last edited info), but you can add your own when you add a new field.

To edit, install more, or create your own, click on the dropdown next to the blue ‚ÄúNew‚Äù button: 

### Views, filters, and sorts
